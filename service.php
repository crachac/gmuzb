                     <h2>Choose your car</h2>
                     As much as you might like to dream about what you want in a car, it's best to think more about what you need â€” not just now, but in the future, too. Functionality should trump flash. Here are some practical considerations to keep in mind:

                     How many passengers do you need to carry?
                     What type of driving do you do: highway, surface streets, off-road?
                     Will you drive in ice and snow?
                     Do you have a long commute and, because of that, is fuel economy important to you?
                     Do you need all-wheel drive?
                     What safety features are important to you?
